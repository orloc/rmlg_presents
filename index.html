						<h2>Some History</h2>
						<h4>how we got here</h4>

						<div class="col-xs-6">
							<p style="font-size: 22px;">
								We were a small industrial and trade focused corporation founded by old friends and revitalized by new players.
								<br><br>
								We moved from high sec early and grew quickly in our new home.  Since that initial arudous journey we have matured into a formidable group who not only have continued to pursue our industrial interests while not losing sight of the space we must defend in order to do so.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="col-xs-6">

					</div>
					<div class="row">
						<p class="small" style="font-size: 15px;">Over the past 6 months we have grown from a small mostly inexperienced group of strangers to a large contributor to one of the largest ( and more progressive ) alliances in the whole of New Eden.  I want to thank and congratulate all of those who  have been with us from the beginning - and welcome all the people just joining for the ride as we all have great hopes for the things to come.<br>

						<h3>Taxes, Taxes, Taxes</h3>
						<h4>THE RENT IS TOO DAMN HIGH</h4>
						<p>WE ARE DROPPING THE CORPORATION TAX TO 0.</p>
						<p>ALL BUY PRICES SHALL REMAIN THE SAME ( they are already essentially at Jita )</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h5>Not Taxes - dues</h5>
						<p>Each member will pay for their alliance contribution <b>AND</b> corporation taxes via a single corporation issued contract. Taxes are calculated by the number of ACCOUNTS a member uses. </p>
						<ul>
							<li>Contracts will be issued to each member monthly</li>
							<li>Tax Formula = SUM( BASE_RATE / ( 1 + PERCENT_FALLOFF )<sup>2</sup> )</li>
							<li>Examples:
								<ol>
									<li>100m </li>
									<li>180m</li>
									<li>244m</li>
									<li>295m</li>
									<li>etc..</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p style="font-size: 22px;">By and large everyone should SAVE money - based on the contributions we recieved and the suggested alliance contribution of 4 hours these numbers seem to work out.<br><br>We have plans to add reductions and "penalties" in the future to create incentives toward acoomplishing corporation and alliance initiatives.</p>
